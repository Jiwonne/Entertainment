Jiwon is good at picking good music and movie.

The program will ask for you "Are you in the good mood for music or movie?"
If you answer to the question, the program will ask your mood in details. 

Engergetic | emotional | sexual

(happy | sad | active, etc) -> in-progress.

Based on your mood, it will automatically open a randomly-selected browser. 
Jiwon already saved the Youtube browser, using an array.

Hope you enjoy jiwon's recommendation!

We can help out each other.
